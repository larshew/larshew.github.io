Angele Lee Duckworth : Teaching students math for 7 years in New York public school - got a lot of data of students.

## What I think of this video
* Have I had a consistent belief which continues more than year? If not, I should be more "grit".
* Even this video doesn't contain very hard word, I could not fully understand whole sentences. I should try hard to listen to other English-saying materials.
